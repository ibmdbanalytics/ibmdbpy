Upload to Pypi:
1. Download from Github
2. in ibmdbpy-master:
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
twine upload dist/ibmdbpy-VERSION*

To make the doc:
cd docs
make html

To run the test:
cd tests
py.test (see documentation for options --dsn, --jdbc --table etc)

To upload the doc:
1. Make a zip with the content of the docs/build/html folder
2. Upload the documentation in the ibmdbpy pypi administrator interface

Good practices: 
=> Test the deployement on testpypi before release:
python setup.py register -r pypitest
python setup.py sdist upload -r pypitest

=> Use twine to upload the package
Note that you should have the ~/.pypirc correctly set
A nice explaination here, from Peter Downs: http://peterdowns.com/posts/first-time-with-pypi.html

=> Ensure back-compatibility to Python 2
The code is natively developed in Python 3. 
We use future and six as compatibility layer
Run pasteurize before uploading new content, 
e.g "pasteurize -wv ." will pasteurize all py files in the path, with verbose mode
